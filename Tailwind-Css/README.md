# Tailwind CSS Setup Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using Tailwind CSS in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. Installation steps depend on your operating system:

### Install Node.js and npm

#### **Windows**
- Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
- npm is included with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically.

#### **Linux**
Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

#### **Mac**
- Install Node.js using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  ```bash
  brew install node
  brew install npm
  ```

### Verify Installation
After installation, verify Node.js and npm are installed by running:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS

Follow these steps to set up Tailwind CSS in your project:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
```

### 2. Initialize Tailwind CSS
Initialize Tailwind CSS by running:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
This will generate a `tailwind.config.js` file and a `postcss.config.js` file.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS
Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and update the `content` property to specify where Tailwind should look for HTML or other files using its classes. Add the following:
```javascript
content: ["*"]
```

### 4. Create a CSS File
Create a file named `main.css` in your project directory and add the following lines:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 5. Link the CSS File
Include the `main.css` file in your HTML file. Add the following `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section:
```html
<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Running the Project

### Add Start Script
Update the `package.json` file by adding the following script under the `"scripts"` section:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite"
}
```

### Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the server:
```bash
npm run start
```
Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar port as shown in the terminal.

## Optional: VS Code Extension
For better development experience, install the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension provides:
- Autocomplete for Tailwind CSS classes.
- Documentation on hover.
- Linting for Tailwind CSS classes.

## Final Steps
Your Tailwind CSS environment is now set up. Start creating your project and use Tailwind classes to design your pages.
